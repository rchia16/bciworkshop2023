# BCI Workshop

This repository is part of the hands-on workshop on how to bridge the gap between Neuroscience and Computational Intelligence to design and develop Brain-Computer Interface. This workshop intends to promote standardization of terminologies and technologies for Brain-Computer Interfaces to computational intelligence practitioners and Neuroscience communities. The workshop promotes the utilization of open-source tools such as Google TensorFlow for enhancing community cohesion and BCI standardization. This repository is only a section of the workshop. See the official webiste below for full information.
